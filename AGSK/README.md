## AGSK Algorithm
*******************************************
This package is a MATLAB/Octave implementation of the [Adaptive Gaining Sharing Knowledge Based (AGSK) Algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC48606.2020.9185901) applied to the CEC 2021 single-objective bound-constrained optimization problem. For more details, please  see the following paper:
